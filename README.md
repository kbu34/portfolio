# Phillip's Portfolio Website Repository

Welcome to my portfolio website repository!  
Here you will find the source code for my portfolio website.

This is also my first Next.js project so you may find some bugs or other problems.  
In those cases please email me at phillipkim156@gmail.com or use the contact form on the website to contact me.  
I'm also taking feedback through those same channels, looking forward to those emails!

## Todo List

- Upgrade Next.js version to 15
- Update projects section with upcoming projects
- Redesign abouts section to contain more information

## If you want to run this website locally for some reason...

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Have fun!
